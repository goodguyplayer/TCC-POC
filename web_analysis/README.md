# Web_Analysis

Directory with the main purpose of studying the web packages in python.


## Links and modules found.

[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html). While not the priority right now, this package may be interesting to study when it comes to the main software. Helps develop graphs.

[Network packet sniffing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_penetration_testing/python_penetration_testing_network_packet_sniffing.htm). More of a guide to python 2.x, but may work for our purpose.
