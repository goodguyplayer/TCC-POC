# TCC-POC

Proof of Concept for the [main project](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/TCC-MainSoftware). 
The goal here is to practice, test and simulate the attack, using the [algorithm developed](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/TCC-DataTraining).

The primary goal is to develop and analyse how web packages are understood on python, with the next goal to determine and see whether the user is under attack.

Therefore, a large quantity will be test code, documentation, study and research.

## Initial rules
- The main branch is the one that works.
- Keep the changelog updated.
- Document all changes, notes and studies. Every link counts.
